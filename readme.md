## 1. Compiler Design (CO - 302)  
#### Recommended books :  
1.[Compilers - *Aho, Ullman, Sethi*](https://goo.gl/nWnn7F)  [*PDF as soon as i find it*]

* There's *three*  version of the this book, with different set of authors. one's by just Alo and Ullman, this is the oldest book and doesn't have much in it in terms of examples and details. this is **NOT** recommended.  
* The next is by Alo, Ullman, and Sethi. This book has the right balance of Examples and theory. This *IS THE RECOMMENDED COURSE BOOK*.
* The final one is by Alo, Ullman, Sethi, and Lam. This book has a lot repetition in topics and explanation. Though this is the most easily available one on [Amazon](https://goo.gl/nWnn7F).

2. Compilers - Construction and Design *Rajni Jindal* [*Link as soon as i find them*]
* This is good of theory and points about topics. Especially useful from an examination point of view. Everything is in the form of points.

#### Details :  
* The lab work and code files can be found [here](/CO302_Compiler_Design/CD_Lab/). The work in divided into two, in-lab work and in-file work. The in lab work is more complex and project-ish, while the in file work follows the university programs list. The in-lab work goes well beyond the university list.
* Class notes are detailed and are on the OneNote (if you're reading this then it means you have the access to the drive or the semester has ended and I've put em up here).
## 2. Artificial Intelligence (CO - 304)
#### Recommended books :  
1. [Artificial Intelligence - Rich, Knight](https://goo.gl/17bhgx)
* This is the main text for the subject. It covers all topics stated in the syllabus and has decent explanation of all algorithms needed. 
2. [A First Course in Artificial Intelligence - Deepak Khemani](https://goo.gl/xrLrsU)
* This is the secret weapon book that only a few know of. Daya Gupta ma'ams notes are based off this and so are the ppts. Use this to thy best advantage.
3. [Artificial Intelligence : A Modern Approach](https://goo.gl/HnzFsv) [[PDF]](https://goo.gl/4DWPg8)
* The OG artificial intelligence book. This is the bible of the subject. If there's any topic anywhere that you can't understand, refer this.

#### Details :  
* There's no lab for this subject (IKR!?), but there's *"Frequent"* assignments which can be found [HERE](/CO304_Artificial_Intelligence/).
* The class notes are on the OneNote book (if you're reading this then it means you have the access to the drive or the semester has ended and I've put em up here).
* Recommended: Use class notes in conjunction with the book.

## 3. Computer Networks(CO - 306)  
#### Recommended books :
1. [Data Communications and Networking - Forouzan](https://goo.gl/8iBbw9) [[PDF]](https://goo.gl/2q1kz1)
* The recommended book for the course. Use it along with its PPTs. Notes are useless. You're on your own in this subject.

2. [Computer Networks - Tanenbaum](https://goo.gl/jMN38f) [[PDF]](https://goo.gl/XdwyNU)
* Secondary book for the subject. Some topics are better here than Forouzan.

#### Details :  

* You're on your own kiddo.

## 4. Cyber Forensics (IT - 312)  
#### Recommended books :  

lol wut

#### Details :

- as lol as things get
- just read the ppts
- pro tip AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

## 5. Parallel Algorithms (SE-324)  
#### Recommended books :

* The Design and Analysis of Parallel Algorithms - Salim G. Akl [[PDF]](https://goo.gl/GiL5Eo)

#### Details :
* Just pay attention in class and Don't slack off with the projects.
* The lab work can be found [here](/SE324_Parallel_Algorithms/PA_LAB).
* The assignment can be found [here](https://github.com/IsCoelacanth/PA_Assignment)

## 6. Technical Communication (HU - 302)  
#### Recommended books :
- Technical Communication - Principles & Practice - Meenakshi Raman, Sangeeta Sharma. (Book available for free reading on scribd)

#### Details :
