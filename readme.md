## 1. Compiler Design (CO - 302)  
#### Recommended books :  
1.[Compilers - *Aho, Ullman, Sethi*](https://goo.gl/nWnn7F)  [*PDF as soon as i find it*]

* There's *three*  version of the this book, with different set of authors. one's by just Alo and Ullman, this is the oldest book and doesn't have much in it in terms of examples and details. this is **NOT** recommended.  
* The next is by Alo, Ullman, and Sethi. This book has the right balance of Examples and theory. This *IS THE RECOMMENDED COURSE BOOK*.
* The final one is by Alo, Ullman, Sethi, and Lam. This book has a lot repetition in topics and explanation. Though this is the most easily available one on [Amazon](https://goo.gl/nWnn7F).

2. Compilers - Construction and Design *Rajni Jindal* [*Link as soon as i find them*]
* This is good of theory and points about topics. Especially useful from an examination point of view. Everything is in the form of points.

#### Details :  
* The lab work and code files can be found [here](/CO302_Compiler_Design/CD_Lab/). The work in divided into two, in-lab work and in-file work. The in lab work is more complex and project-ish, while the in file work follows the university programs list. The in-lab work goes well beyond the university list.
* Class notes are detailed and will be available soon [-> HERE <-]
